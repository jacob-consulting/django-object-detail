# Introduction
Properties can be rendered as bootstrap badges if defined in the configuration.

# Colors
Use the bootstrap colors, see https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/badge/#background-colors

Either confiture the color manually or set the color based on the property value.
This could be either a simple map that maps the value of the property to a color
or a lambda function which returns the color based on the property value.

# Labels
As default, show the label as if it was rendered without the badge.

Optionally, define a map similar to the color map, to show match the label of the badge. 

# Pill
Optionally, render the badge as a pill, see https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/badge/#pill-badges
