# Abstract
Add a README.md to the project.

Add a short description of the library, what it is for and why it is cool.

Provide screenshots of the library in action from the example project.
If you cannot add screenshots, add placeholders with annotations so I can add them later manually.

Add a documentation section that describes how to use the library.
Start simple and add more details later.
